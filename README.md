# Financial Distress Prediction Using Machine Learning
## Overview
  ### This project focuses on predicting financial distress in the Indian automobile sector using machine learning techniques. By analyzing financial and non-financial metrics of companies, the study identifies early warning signs of financial distress, helping investors, policymakers, and businesses make informed decisions.

## Key Features
 ### Utilizes machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost.
### Incorporates widely-used bankruptcy prediction models such as Altman Z-Score, Springate Method, and Zmijewski Method.
### Evaluates financial health based on a company’s performance metrics over a three-year period.
### Supports early identification of financial distress for strategic decision-making.
## Dataset
### The dataset includes:

### Financial ratios (e.g., current ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, return on assets, return on equity).
### Non-financial data (e.g., market trends, industry performance).
### Historical financial data from Indian automobile companies spanning 2020–2022.
